What to learn from this excersie:

1) default dictonary makes a default space in a dictionary
2) approach the problem by rows and cols.
    check each row if it is already in your set
    if it is in your set return false
3) approach the squares the same way as you approach rows and cols.
    each key for a square is r/3 and c/3. 1/3 gives each square a unique coordinate.
    1/3 also normalize each data point to a certain square
