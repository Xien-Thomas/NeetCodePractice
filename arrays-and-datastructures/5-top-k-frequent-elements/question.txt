Given an array of nums and a integer k
return the k most frequent elements
you may return in any order


Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
k is in the range [1, the number of unique elements in the array].
It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.


////thoughts
input nums, k
output is list k

sort(nums) nlgn

every iteration of k
grab the highest number while mapping which number is used already

111
22
nlgn + m*n =m*n

//do better

n

hashmap nums +=1

compare length in hash map
max == 5
max 3
